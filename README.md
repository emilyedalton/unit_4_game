# Object Collector

Math.random statement generates a random number at the start of the game, while separate math.random statements generate random numbers for the objects displayed on the screen. The value of each object is hidden from from the user. If they successfully use the objects assigned values to match the generated number they win and the game resets, otherwise they lose and the game resets.
